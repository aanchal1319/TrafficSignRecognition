# Traffic Sign Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting traffic signs in images using [mention your framework or technology, e.g., TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc.]. The system identifies various traffic signs present in the input image and provides relevant information about them.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

numpy
Pillow
keras==2.3.1
tensorflow==1.14.0
flask
Werkzeug
gunicorn

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aanchal1319/TrafficSignRecognition
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Traffic_app.py
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the traffic sign detection system, follow these instructions:

1. Prepare your image dataset or use the provided sample images in the 'images' directory.

2. Execute the main script:

    ```bash
    python detect_traffic_signs.py --input <path_to_input_image>
    ```

    Replace `<path_to_input_image>` with the path to your image file.

3. Wait for the detection process to complete.

4. View the output displayed or saved in the 'output' directory, showing detected traffic signs and their information.
